# Page Load Optimization

A slow-loading page impacts user experience and SEO. Below are three common causes of slow page loads and their solutions:

1. **Large Image or Asset Sizes**
   - **Cause**: Unoptimized images or large CSS/JS files increase payload, slowing downloads.
   - **Solution**: 
     - Compress images with tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim.
     - Use WebP format for better compression.
     - Minify CSS/JS with UglifyJS or CSSNano.
     - Implement lazy loading for off-screen assets.

2. **Excessive or Unoptimized Server Requests**
   - **Cause**: Multiple HTTP requests or slow server responses delay rendering.
   - **Solution**: 
     - Bundle CSS/JS files to reduce requests.
     - Use a CDN to serve assets from nearby servers.
     - Cache API responses (e.g., Redis) and optimize database queries (e.g., add indexes).

3. **Render-Blocking Resources**
   - **Cause**: CSS/JS files that block rendering until fully loaded.
   - **Solution**: 
     - Defer non-critical JS with `defer`/`async` attributes.
     - Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content.
     - Use Lighthouse to identify and prioritize render-blocking resources.

**Additional Notes**:
- Use Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights to diagnose issues.
- Monitor metrics like TTFB, FCP, and LCP.
- Test across devices and network conditions for consistent performance.
